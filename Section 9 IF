if statement the statement is the most basic of the C plus plus selection statements and his syntax couldn't be any simpler.
syntax :    if (expr)       // the  expression must evaluate to boolean true or fasle value
              statement;    // if the value of expression is true then the statement is executed otherwise the statement skipped
              
  ***   lets conceptually see what's going on in the if statement.     ****
        ===========================================================
        
   *Block statement
   ==================
   it introdcue a new level or scope(detailed later)
   as we declare a variable in main block , we can declare a variable at any block , but note that variable declared in a block will be only divisible in the same block
   
   
   else
   =====
   if (expr)
      statement1;
   else if (expr)
      statement3;   
   else
      statement2;
 ===========================
 Nested if statement
 ===========================
 if (expr)
      if (expr)
      statement1;
  else                  //in C++ , else belongs to the closest if(dengling else problem)
      statement2;
      
      NOTE : we have 2 ifs and 1 else , in computer science that called the dangling else problem and every programing language has to decide how to handle it
   in C++ else is belongs to the closest if
